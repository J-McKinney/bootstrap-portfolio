        <p id="paragraph">Well, what's to say? I'm 33 years old, I just
            got married last September, life is good. Just
            repetitive... My life outside of work is great,
            spontaneous, and exciting. That's why I decided
            to go for a career change. I've seen it all and
            done it all, as a bartender. I started in the food
            and beverage industry when I was 16 years old. I
            started as a dishwasher, busboy, server, etc...
            And, so on. And, so forth. After 17 years of doing
            this and the wide experience of fine dining and
            "THE RUSH" of casual dining. Nothing is unexpected
            anymore. So, I got bored and picked up hobbies, to
            unleash a more creative side of myself. While still
            working full-time, I decided to do a little wood
            working. It started off small, then it got bigger.
            Along with building my own workbench to the patio
            furniture on my deck. What can I say? The feeling
            you get when a plan goes into action and the end
            result is even better than you thought it would
            be. Unbelievable!!! You don't want to stop. You
            want to go out and build a house, from the ground
            up. The only, tiniest, minute, pocket-sized
            problem with that is.... After, I got done with
            those projects, I had nothing in my pockets to
            afford new material, for the new projects. So,
            looking for an alternative. I had a friend suggest
            the tech frontier. So, I looked into it. We live in
            the digital age, the age of computers and technology.
            You want to know what I saw? I saw a "free, limitless,
            canvas of creativivty". HTML is my hammer and saw, CSS
            is my endless lumber yard. Now, that I have started
            this. I don't want it to end...</p>
